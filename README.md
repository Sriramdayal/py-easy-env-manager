# 🐍 Py-Easy-Env: The Visual Python Environment Manager

A modern **graphical user interface (GUI)** for managing Python project dependencies and environments — without the hassle of complex command-line workflows.  

Inspired by tools like **Poetry** and **Pipenv**, but designed with **simplicity** and **visual ease** in mind.  
Perfect for **developers, data scientists, and students** who want a straightforward way to handle project-based dependencies.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🎯 **Project-Based Management**  
  Create and switch between isolated projects. Dependencies for Project A won’t interfere with Project B.  

- 🔍 **Smart Code Scanning**  
  Automatically scans your Python files for imports and suggests dependencies.  

- ⚡ **One-Click Dependency Management**  
  Add or remove packages instantly. Automatically generates and updates a `requirements.txt`.  

- 🔄 **Intelligent Environment Syncing**  
  Switching projects automatically syncs dependencies — no more mismatched environments.  

- 🛠️ **Self-Healing Environments**  
  If required tools (`pip-tools`, `pipreqs`, etc.) are missing, Py-Easy-Env detects and installs them.  

- 🖥️ **GUI-First Workflow**  
  No need to remember CLI commands — everything is done through an intuitive interface.

## 🛠️ Workflow

1. **Create a Project**
   Give your project a name (e.g., `web-scraper`). A dedicated folder will be created to manage it.

2. **Add Dependencies**

   * Use **“Scan Code for Imports”** to auto-detect dependencies.
   * Or add packages manually via the **Add Dependency** input field.

3. **Sync Environments**
   Dependencies are auto-synced whenever you add or remove a package.

4. **Switch Projects**
   Select another project from the dropdown. Py-Easy-Env automatically updates the environment to match.
